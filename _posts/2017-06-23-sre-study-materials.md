I feel like at some point in the past, I used to be a pretty decent sysadmin--I
mean DevOps--I mean SRE. Over the years, the specialization in HPC and subsequent
relegation to management has displaced most of the knowledge I used to have. For
no particular reason, I thought it might be nice to see what resources are available
that one could use to brush up on one's Linux chops.

Since the only person reading this is me (hi me!) I'll just make relevant posts
as I find materials?

Without much thought, I roughly see these breaking down into a few categories, to be
used later as tags:

Linux Internals
===============

Just general linux-ey and unix-ey things. Kernel, processes, concurrency, IPC, etc.

System Design
=============

Something along the lines of what Google calls Non-Abstract Large Scale Design.
I'm not sure exactly how this differs from the HPC stuff I've been doing, but I
think I'll find out along the way. Thinking about these systems without being
restricted by MPI, IB, POSIX filesystems, etc. will be interesting.

Troubleshooting
===============

'nuff said

Sysadmin Skillz
===============

Should this be combined with Troubleshooting?

Algorithms/Data Structures
==========================

Not sure how much of this I consider to be SRE vs. SWE, but I guess we'll see how it
progresses.
